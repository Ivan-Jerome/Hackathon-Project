#HACKATHON MOCK PROJECT

TASK:
To retrieve CPU Data from a input file and find the Average and Maximum CPU Value and store them in the Database using mySQL. Then to print and store the same in a JSON Object.

SOLUTION:

STEP 1: Create a JAVA Project and class
STEP 2: Add external JAR file ( Java JSON and mySQL Connector)
STEP 3: Read the input file and identify the required value. Then convert that string to an integer value.
STEP 4: Calculate the Average and Maximum CPU Value
STEP 5: Connect to mySQL and store the Transaction Name, Average Value and Maximum Value
STEP 6: Create a JSON Object and store all the CPU Value along with iteration value
STEP 7: Print the input file and the JSON object
